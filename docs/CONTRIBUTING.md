#How to contribute to BeastBot

So you think you have what it takes to run with the big dogs huh? Well first there's a couple of things you gotta know about how we do things around here...

##Coding Style
There's not really a deffined coding styler per say, as long as your code is readable and doesn't make me want to poke my eyes out then it's okay. I would like it if you at least ran `pep8.py` on it first so that it at least in part conformes with python practices but don't sweat it if it's not 100%.

##Copyright
I swear on me mum if anyone violates copyrights I'll bash you in the gabba m8. So says the mighty Bob Gnarly!
